            <h2>Questions/Answers</h2>
            <p>
                <b>Do all links work?</b> Yes. All links work splendidly. <br>
                <b>Was the "contact us" form easy to understand?</b> Yes. The contact page was very easy to understand and self-explanatory. <br> 
                <b>How is the coloring?</b> Coloring is very nice: there was an abundance of neutral colors which is nice, and there was nothing distracting. <br>
                <b>Is the text easy to read?</b> Text was very clear to read. The font was really easy on the eyes. <br>
                <b>How is the sizing of the page and images?</b> Pages and images were sized well, the images were the perfect size because it was at the
                focal point of the screen so my eyed didn't have to move away or around to understand the information in the picture.
                It complemented the larger span of the text really well. <br> 
                <b>Did the page load fast?</b> The pages loaded pretty fast. The only exception was the about page which took about half-a second longer to load. <br>
                <b>What browser did you use?</b> Google Chrome. <br>
                <b>Was the website compatible with your browser?</b> Yes. <br>
                <b>Additional comments?</b> The video on the about page was too pixelated for my taste.
