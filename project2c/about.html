            <h2>Who we are</h2>
            <p>
                ParkourATL started as a group of 4 highschoolers that thought running and jumping around was cool. Now it is the largest community of hackers in the Atlanta Metropolitan Area. People from all races, ranging from highschoolers to 30-year-old veterans join us every weekend at several urban locations to enjoy the art of parkour and free-running. Our events gather the most extreme and exciting traceurs in the south. If you like adrenaline, love to run and exercise, and want to meet people with the same interests, ParkourATL has your back!

            <h2>What we do</h2>
            <p>
                We believe that we all learn by doing. We like getting adventurous people that will jump right into the action and get the best out of themselves! That is why every Saturday we hold meetups at four locations throughout the Atlanta Metropolitan Area: Marietta, Alpharetta, Doraville, and Decatur. We also host a big event the first Sunday of May and September, called The Peach Run, where hundreds of national and international traceurs attend in order to show off their skills to the rest of the world.
